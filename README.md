Java library for functional style "Railway Oriented Programming"

This library was inspired by [Railway Oriented Programming](http://de.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/railway-oriented-programming) and the [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html) type of the Rust programming language. It contains utilities that enable functional style programming in Java with under-the-hood error handling without having to define try-catch-blocks or conditionals.
